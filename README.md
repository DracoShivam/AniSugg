AniSuggest: AI-Powered Anime Recommendation Engine
AniSuggest is an intelligent web platform designed to provide anime fans with highly personalized and semantically relevant recommendations. Moving beyond simple genre-matching, AniSuggest uses modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the core themes and narrative of an anime's synopsis, allowing it to uncover hidden gems and suggest content that truly resonates with a user's specific tastes.

Live Demo: https://ani-sugg.vercel.app/

‚ú® Features
Semantic Search: Find anime based on the meaning and themes of their stories, not just keywords.

Content-Based Recommendations: Get a list of similar shows based on any anime you're interested in ("Because you viewed...").

Personalized "For You" Page: The app analyzes your entire watched history to create a unique "taste profile," generating recommendations tailored specifically to you.

Dynamic Filtering: Already-watched anime are automatically filtered out from all recommendation and browsing lists.

Interactive UI: A sleek, modern, and responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is a full-stack application built with a modern technology stack, as outlined in the initial PRD.

Component

Technology

Rationale

Frontend

React (Vite) & TypeScript

For a fast, modern, and type-safe user interface.

Backend

Python & FastAPI

High-performance API framework within a robust AI/ML ecosystem.

Database

MongoDB

Flexible NoSQL database for storing user profiles and watched lists.

AI Model

sentence-transformers

State-of-the-art library for generating high-quality vector embeddings from text.

Deployment

Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend), MongoDB Atlas (Database)

A serverless, scalable, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure.

üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Git

Python 3.11+

Node.js and npm

MongoDB Community Server (ensure the service is running)

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/anisugg.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/anisugg.git)
cd anisugg

Setup the Backend:

Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Crucial Step: Run the data processing script to fetch the anime data and generate the AI model files. This will create a data folder.

python scripts/process_data.py

Start the backend server. It will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

uvicorn main:app --reload

Setup the Frontend:

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install the required npm packages:

npm install

Run the frontend development server. It will be available at http://localhost:5173.

npm run dev

You should now have the full application running locally!

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
The live version of this application is deployed using a modern cloud stack:

The React frontend is hosted on Vercel, which automatically deploys on every push to the main branch.

The FastAPI backend is hosted as a Web Service on Render, which also deploys automatically.

The MongoDB database is a managed cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

The MONGO_URI and VITE_API_URL are configured as environment variables in their respective cloud services for security and flexibility.

üìù Future Work
This project has a solid foundation, but there are many exciting features to add from the Post-MVP roadmap:

V1.1: MyAnimeList Integration: Allow users to import their existing watch history from MAL.

V1.2: Advanced Filtering: Add filters for genre, studio, and release year on the browse page.

V1.3: Rating System: Implement a 1-10 rating system to create a weighted "taste profile" for more accurate recommendations.
