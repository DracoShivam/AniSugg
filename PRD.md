## **1\. Introduction & Vision**

### **1.1. Overview**

AniSuggest is an intelligent, AI-powered web platform designed to provide anime fans with highly personalized and semantically relevant recommendations. Moving beyond simple genre-matching, AniSuggest uses modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the core meaning, themes, and narrative of an anime's synopsis. This allows the platform to uncover hidden gems and suggest content that truly resonates with a user's specific tastes.

### **1.2. Problem Statement**

Anime viewers, from casual fans to seasoned enthusiasts, often face "discovery fatigue." Existing recommendation systems on major streaming platforms are often superficial, recommending only mainstream hits or shows with identical genre tags. This makes it difficult for users to find new series that match the nuanced themes and narrative styles they enjoy, leading them to re-watch old favorites or spend excessive time searching for their next show.

### **1.3. Target Audience**

* **The Casual Viewer:** Watches anime on platforms like Netflix or Crunchyroll but struggles to find new shows once they've finished the most popular ones.  
* **The Enthusiast:** Maintains a detailed list of watched anime (e.g., on MyAnimeList) and is looking for a sophisticated tool that can provide non-obvious recommendations based on their extensive viewing history.

## **2\. Goals & Success Metrics**

### **2.1. Product Goals**

* **Goal 1:** Provide a superior discovery experience by delivering highly accurate, semantically-driven anime recommendations.  
* **Goal 2:** Increase user engagement by creating a personalized "taste profile" that evolves with a user's viewing history.  
* **Goal 3:** Become the go-to third-party tool for anime discovery and tracking.

### **2.2. Success Metrics (First 6 Months Post-Launch)**

* **Engagement:** Achieve an average of 3+ anime added to a user's "watched" list per session.  
* **Relevance:** Attain a 40% click-through rate on anime displayed in recommendation carousels.  
* **Retention:** Achieve a 15% month-over-month user retention rate.

## **3\. Features & Requirements**

### **Epic 1: Core Discovery & Viewing Experience**

| ID | Requirement | User Story |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **FR-001** | **Homepage Anime Grid** | As a user, I want to see a browsable grid of popular anime on the homepage so I can visually explore what's available. |
| **FR-002** | **Search Functionality** | As a user, I want a search bar to find a specific anime by its title. |
| **FR-003** | **Detailed View Page** | As a user, I want to click on any anime to see a detailed page with its poster, title, full synopsis, genres, and studio. |

### **Epic 2: AI-Powered Recommendations**

| ID | Requirement | User Story |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **FR-004** | **Content-Based Recommendations** | As a user, when viewing an anime's detail page, I want to see a list of recommendations titled "Because you viewed..." based on its story's similarity to others. |
| **FR-005** | **Semantic Similarity Engine** | The backend must use a pre-trained Transformer model to convert anime synopses into numerical vectors (embeddings) to capture semantic meaning. |
| **FR-006** | **Vector Matching Logic** | The system must use Cosine Similarity to calculate the distance between vectors and identify the most similar anime. |

### **Epic 3: User Personalization & History**

| ID | Requirement | User Story |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **FR-007** | **User Accounts** | As a user, I want to be able to sign up and log in to an account to save my activity. |
| **FR-008** | **Watched List Functionality** | As a logged-in user, I want to click an "Add to Watched" button on an anime's detail page to add it to my personal history. |
| **FR-009** | **Profile-Based Recommendations** | As a logged-in user, I want to see a personalized "Recommended For You" list based on an analysis of my entire watched history. |
| **FR-010** | **Taste Profile Algorithm** | The "Recommended For You" list must be generated by averaging the vectors of all anime in a user's watched list to create a unique "taste profile" vector. |
| **FR-011** | **Exclusion of Watched Anime** | The system must automatically filter out any anime from all recommendation lists that the user has already marked as watched. |

## **4\. Technical Specifications**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Frontend** | React (with TypeScript) | Modern, component-based architecture for building a dynamic and responsive UI. TypeScript ensures code quality and scalability. |
| **Backend** | Python (with FastAPI) | Python provides a robust ecosystem for AI/ML. FastAPI is a high-performance framework ideal for building the required API endpoints. |
| **Database** | MongoDB | A flexible NoSQL database well-suited for storing user profiles and lists of watched anime IDs. |
| **AI Model** | Sentence-Transformers | A user-friendly library for easily deploying state-of-the-art NLP models to generate vector embeddings. |
| **Deployment** | Docker & AWS | Containerization with Docker ensures consistency. AWS provides a scalable, production-ready environment (Amplify, App Runner, DocumentDB). |

## **5\. Assumptions & Constraints**

* **Assumption:** A reliable, public API (e.g., Jikan) will be available for sourcing the initial anime dataset.  
* **Assumption:** Users will find semantic recommendations more valuable than purely genre-based ones and will be willing to create an account for a personalized experience.  
* **Constraint:** The initial version (MVP) will not include collaborative filtering (e.g., "users who watched X also watched Y") and will focus solely on content-based filtering.  
* **Constraint:** The initial dataset will be limited to the top 1000-2000 most popular anime to ensure manageable processing times.

## **6\. Future Considerations (Post-MVP Roadmap)**

* **V1.1: MyAnimeList Integration:** Allow users to import their existing watch history from MAL to instantly create their taste profile.  
* **V1.2: Advanced Filtering:** Allow users to filter recommendations by genre, studio, release year, and other metadata.  
* **V1.3: Rating System:** Introduce a 1-10 rating system and use these ratings to create a weighted average for the taste profile vector, improving accuracy.  
* **V2.0: Collaborative Filtering:** Implement a hybrid recommendation engine that incorporates collaborative filtering to suggest anime that similarly-tasted users have enjoyed.
